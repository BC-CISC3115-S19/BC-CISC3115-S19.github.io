  <h2>Project 1: A More Object-Oriented Mancala</h2>


  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>We've spent some time thinking about the mancala game... I gave you a largely-complete chunk of code to play a simple version of the game and asked you to fill in the actual game play. Hopefully, you spent some time thinking about that on your own time, as I strongly suggested. We also discussed the limitations of the approach in my code&mdash;in particular, it's not very object-oriented, which created some obvious duplications in code (e.g. two arrays of pits). In this project, I'm providing 98% of the game logic and asking you to implement a better design. This is probably a new kind of assignment for many of you: I'm not asking you to write the right kind of loops and conditionals, but I'm asking you to think about the <em>design and structure</em> of your code.</p>


  <h3>Primary Task</h3>

  <p>Here is updated code for mancala: <a href="PlayMancala.java">PlayMancala.java</a>; <a href="MancalaBoard.java">MancalaBoard.java</a>. <code>PlayMancala</code> is essentially unchanged from the version I shared in <a href="../exercises/exercise1.html">Exercise 1</a>, but <code>MancalaBoard</code> now has fairly complete game-play logic&mdash;though you'll notice that the <code>playMove()</code> method only deals with a move made by <em>player 1</em>. Review the code and the comments to be sure you understand what this class does and doesn't do.</p>

  <p>Your primary task is to convert this code to use a <code>Player</code> class, one that represents the data and actions of a single player (obviously, the game will then need two <code>Player</code> objects). <code>PlayMancala</code> does not need to change, but <code>MancalaBoard</code> will be substantially reorganized, and some of the "logic" currently in the <code>MancalaBoard</code> class will move into the new <code>Player</code> class.</p>

  <h4>Style and Documentation</h4>

  <p>Part of your task is to produce a fully documented, stylistically acceptable project. When you are writing a Java program (or a program in most any language), your main audience is not the computer but <em>other human beings</em> (actually, your primary audience is often yourself-next-week). Your code must be easy for other programmers to read, digest, and comprehend. This is why variable names, whitespace, and other "fussy" things are so important. Indeed, most software companies have their own "style guides" so that everyone's code follows the same conventions, so everyone knows what they're looking at. For this class, I've made a <a href="../SimplifiedStyleGuide.html">simplified version of Google's Java style guidelines.</a> There are a few items in the guidelines that don't apply to this project (like <code>enum</code>, exceptions, and a few other small things). But everything through section 5 should be pretty clear. Make sure you adhere to this guide!</p>

  <p>In particular, notice that Section 7 of the Simplified Style Guide discusses "Javadoc," which is the special commenting "language" used to document methods and classes in Java. The code I've provided you should be an adequate example&mdash;be sure you put an <code>@author</code> tag at the top of each of your source files.</p>

  <h3>Turning in and Grading</h3>

  <p>To turn in your program, send me a zipfile containing <code>PlayMancala.java</code>, <code>MancalaBoard.java</code>, <code>Player.java</code>, and the <code>.java</code> files for any other classes you write. The zipfile must be named &lt;Lastname&gt;&lt;Firstname&gt;Project1.zip (that is, if I were submitting this, I would send <code>DexterScottProject1.zip</code>. Do not send a file that has been compressed with gzip, RAR, or any other archive/compression format. If you prefer, you may store your zipfile with a cloud service and send me a link. Submissions that don't meet these requirements <em>will not be graded</em>.<p>

<p>Your grade will be based on the following elements:

<pre>
  20%  Compiles and runs
  10%  Runs correctly (game plays properly, etc)
  30%  Appropriate class design.
  20%  Good/readable style (follows guidelines)
  20%  Appropriate comments</pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This grading scheme is based on the assumption that you do a substantial amount of the work of the project. If you turn in something that is essentially what I gave you with a tiny <code>Player</code> class, you will receive a very low score. But if you <em>do</em> do the work, note that 60% of this project is pretty easy to get (compiles and runs, good style, appropriate comments). The remaining 40% is the "real challenge" of this project.

<p>Your email to me must be datestamped by <strong>11:59pm, Tuesday, March 12</strong>. (This gives you a week afterward to focus on studying for the midterm.) Remember that I don't generally accept late assignments. But I'm happy to receive your work well in advance of the deadline.</p>

  <p>Finally, remember that projects are <em>individual</em> work. I strongly discourage you from discussing your work on this, or sharing your code, with teammates or other classmates. In this class, teams are there to <em>support your learning</em>; individual work is where you <em>show me what you've learned</em>.

  <h2>"Appropriate" class design?</h2>

  If you've been following along with the book, you know a lot about the class design process. I strongly suggest that you follow the book's process "from scratch" for the <code>Player</code> class. Remember that <em>encapsulation</em> is a crucial part of class design. I also encourage you to describe your class design in Javadoc comments. Once you decide what the <code>Player</code> class needs, you should be able to find nearly all of the code in the <code>MancalaBoard</code> class (though you will probably need to tweak things a bit to fit into your modified design).</p>
