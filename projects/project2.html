  <h2>Project 2: Swing</h2>


  <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>We've done some small Swing applications together (plus Exercise
  4); in this project, you'll write a slightly more complex
  application that includes some customized components. No-one is
  going to mistake this for a "real" application, but by the time
  you're done, you'll have a pretty solid understanding of many
  aspects of Swing.</p>

<p>Essentially, you're going to write an application that displays a
  list of real estate sales and then lets the user "filter" those
  sales to see the total value of sales by date range.</p>

<p><strong>This is intended to be challenging but doable. DO NOT
    HESITATE to ask me questions! And DO NOT WAIT to start on this!</strong></p>

  <h3>Phase One</h3>

  <p>So, first, write a relatively simple class
  called <code>RealEstateSale</code>. It contains three instance
    variables: <ul>
      <li><code>String country</code>, which contains a
  valid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-letter_country_codes">two-letter country code</a> representing where the sale took place,</li>
      <li><code>double price</code>, which represents
  the amount of the sale (this is expressed in the currency of the
        country, but we'll worry about currency later), and</li>
      <li><code>Date
  dateOfSale</code>, representing the day when the sale was
        completed.</li>
  </ul></p>

  <p>Note that once an object like this is created, it shouldn't be
  changed. So, you should write constructors and getters, but no
  setters. Most of the work is in the constructors: you should make
    sure all three elements are
  valid. <a href="CurrencyConverter.java">Here</a> is a utility class I'm
    providing for this project. <code>CurrencyConverter.countryCodes</code>
  is a list of all the country codes the JRE knows about; you can use
    this to test validity. To create a <code>Date</code> object, we
    use a <code>Calendar</code> object (both in <code>java.util</code>):

    <pre>
Calendar dateMaker = Calendar.getInstance();
dateMaker.set(2019, 3, 15);
Date today = dateMaker.getTime();</pre>

    Note that <code>today</code> represents <em>April</em>
    15&mdash; months are counted from
    0. Your <code>RealEstateSale</code> constructor(s) should
    set <code>countryCode</code> to <code>null</code> if any of the
    parameters it receives are invalid. (And you should probably
    check those values for validity <em>before</em> passing them to
    the constructor, when possible.)</p>


  <h3>Phase Two</h3>

 <p>Now incorporate this class into a Swing application. First, using
   techniques from Exercise 4, create a <code>JList</code> that
   displays the list of sales (of course, you'll have to create that list
   of sales, too! Be sure your data includes at least 10 sales in a
   variety of countries from a decent range of dates). Each sale should be displayed as a string
   containing the relevant info; something like

   <pre>US | November 4, 1984 | 20,000</pre>

   You can use Java to help you format the date nicely:

   <pre>
 DateFormat localDateFormat = DateFormat.getDateInstance();
 String dateString = df.format(today);</pre></p>


  <h3>Phase Three</h3>

<p>Once you have your sale-displaying list working, turn your
  attention to displaying the total value of the sales. Probably you
  can use a simple  <code>JLabel</code> to display this (remember we
  can call <code>setText()</code> to change the text it
  displays). First, get this working assuming that all the sale prices
  are given in dollars. Once you have that logic working, use
  the <code>CurrencyConverter.currConvert()</code> and <code>CurrencyConverter.getCurrency()</code>methods I provide to
  convert the sale prices from the local currency to US dollars
  (country code <code>US</code>). (Note there's a small problem here:
  the method I provide uses the <em>current</em> exchange rate, but
  for sales in the past, it would probably be better to use the
  exchange rate from the date of the sale! But don't worry about that
  for now.)</p>

<p>Finally, add controls that will allow the user to specify the date
  range of the sales whose values are summed for display (so e.g. you
  could ask for the total sales between January 1 and December 31,
  2015). The easiest way to do this is with a <code>JSpinner</code>,
  which has support in the API for working with dates. In particular,
  if you have <code>Date</code> values <code>firstDate</code>
  and <code>lastDate</code>, then you can create
  a <code>JSpinner</code> that lets the user select dates between
  those ranges like this:

  <pre>
SpinnerDateModel model = new SpinnerDateModel(firstDate,              // date initially displayed
                                              firstDate,              // low date in spinner's range
                                              lastDate,               // high date in spinner's range
                                              Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH); // increment target
JSpinner spinner = new JSpinner(model);</pre>

  Note that the first parameter sets the value that is initially
  displayed by the spinner; the last parameter specifies which part of
  the date is incremented by the spinner's controls.</p>

<p>Also note that these spinners should not change what is displayed
  in the <code>JList</code>. They should only affect the displayed sum
  of sale values.</p>

<h3>Turning in and Grading</h3>

  <p>Be sure the class containing <code>main()</code> is
    called <code>ProjectTwo</code>. To turn in your project, send me
    a zipfile containing all the Java source files you created, as
    well as <code>CurrencyConverter.java</code>. The zipfile must be named LastnameFirstnameProject2.zip (that is, if I were submitting this, I would send <code>DexterScottProject2.zip</code>. Do not send a file that has been compressed with gzip, RAR, or any other archive/compression format. If you prefer, you may store your zipfile with a cloud service and send me a link.<p>

<p>Your grade will be based on the following elements (see <a href="project1.html">Project 1</a> for notes about style
	and documentation):

<pre>
  25%  Compiles and runs
  25%  Runs correctly
  10%  Layout is usable. (Clear and understandable, but not fancy)
  20%  Good/readable style (follows guidelines)
  20%  Appropriate comments</pre>


  <p>Your email to me must be datestamped by <strong>6:00pm,
  Wednesday, May 1</strong>. (Three weeks from the date of assignment, though including the holiday week.) Remember that I don't generally accept late assignments. But I'm happy to receive your work well in advance of the deadline.</p>

<h3>Extra Credit Possibilities</h3>

<p>There are lots of behaviors you can add for fun, if you have the
  time and inclination. Adding some or all of these will add up to 10
  points (out of 100) to your score for this project.

  <ul>
    <li>Add controls that allow the user to add additional "records"
      to the list of sales. Probably this would be
      three <code>JTextField</code>s and
      a <code>JButton</code>. Probably your event-handler should check
      to make the data is valid before actually creating a new entry
      in the list.</li>
    <li>Improve the <code>JList</code> display so that the sale prices
    are displayed in the local
      currency. <a href="https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/core-java/util/locale/java-util-locale-example/">Here</a>
      is an example of using <code>Locale</code> with
    the <code>NumberFormat</code> class to get properly formatted
      local currency values.</li>
    <li>Add a control that lets the user control
    the <code>Locale</code> in which the total sale value is displayed
      (rather than being only <code>USA</code>). Also, use this to
    display the sales dates using the local date format.</li>
    <li>Add another control that filters the totaled sales by country
    (so that, for example, we could see the total value of sales in
      Italy during July 2016).</li>
<li>Allow the user to select&mdash;by clicking on them&mdash;the sales they want
  included in the total sale sum (this will involve exploring the <code>JList</code> multi-select behavior).</li>
    <li>Modify <code>CurrencyConverter.currConvert()</code> to return the
    currency exchange rate of a specific date. This is a little
    hairier than it sounds, mainly because Java SE does not include
      JSON support.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other additions are certainly possible, but please check with me
    about their "extra-creditworthiness" before you implement them.</p>
