  <h2>Exercise 4: Model-View-Controller</h2>

  <h3>Objectives:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Implement a Swing application</li>
    <li>Understand the elements of the Model-View-Controller design
      pattern</li>
    <li>Be able to customize the behavior of some Swing components
  </ul>

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>[Note: this is an extended version of the introductory materials I asked you to read before class. I've highlighted the tasks I'm asking you to <strong>in this face</strong>, but there's a little more reading to do around them, as well.]</p>

  <p>In this exercise, we're going to focus on the Model-View-Controller <em>design pattern</em> we talked about briefly in class. There are two reasons for this: (1) MVC is a very commonly used design pattern, across many languages and application contexts; (2) MVC is (I think) a helpful way of thinking concretely about design, about how you can create effective <em>relationships</em> among objects in your applications.</p>

  <p>This exercise has two parts. First, we'll look at another version of the "SwingLine" code that we looked at during the application activities, and we'll see how the code can be "refactored" to make it even more MVC-ish. Then, we'll look at how Swing itself uses MVC to design many of the Swing components. This will involve a fair amount of API-reading, and not so much code-writing... but that's actually how things go a lot of the time: you have to read a fair amount before you figure out how to write a couple lines of code.</p>


  <h3>MVC Intro/Review</h3>
  <p>I talked for a few minutes in class about
  Model-View-Controller. That was no accident. While there are many
  design patterns floating around Java, MVC shows up a lot in
  Swing. And beginning to think in terms of design patterns is an
  important step in your development as a software developer. (For
    example, there are
  a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+design+pattern+design+patterns+books&sa=X">ton</a>
  of books written about design patterns, many focusing on a
    particular programming language.)</p>

  <p>As we saw in the big-small-circle application, MVC is often used
  to structure the user interface of an application; it's a useful way
  make sure we're keeping the three kinds of behavior (keeping track of data [the model], displaying the data [the view], and letting the user change the data [the controller]) fairly separate
  from each other (and therefore making sure that we're not
    programming like that jerk Larry).


    <h3><code>SwingLine</code> MVC</h3>

  <p><a href="SwingLineMVC.java">Here</a> is the source code for a "fully" Model-View-Controller version of the SwingLine application we also looked at last week. Take a look. The big difference between last week's version and this week's version is that I put the "application data" (in this case, the length and thickness of the line) into its own class, which I called <code>LineModel</code>. Most of the behavior in this class is essentially getter and setter behavior. But there is some additional code relating to the fact that this is part of an MVC design: when the data in the model changes, other objects (especially the View) may want to know about the change so they can update in response. So, I wrote <code>LineModel</code> to <code>extend Observable</code>. The <code>Observable</code> class offers the basic behavior of allowing other objects to "register" as "listeners" (similar to buttons and <code>ActionListeners</code>s). So a class that extends <code>Observable</code> gets all that behavior automatically. You'll also see that the main application class implements the <code>Observer</code> interface, which includes a single method, <code>update()</code>. My definition of the <code>update()</code> method tells the various elements of my View to update themselves with the new data from the Model. Read the documentation for <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Observable.html">Observable</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Observer.html">Observer</a>&mdash;you'll see that these have been <em>deprecated</em> because they're not as flexible and powerful and modern applications require, but they're still very good for exploring the foundational concepts.</p>

  <p>Here are two small tasks for you to do with this code:
    <ol>
      <li>The comments note that things would be a little easier if <code>LineModel</code> offered methods to increment and decrement the thickness. <strong>Add those methods, and update the rest of the code to use those methods.</strong> Hint: these new methods should do very little work&mdash;they should re-use code you've already written, i.e. they should call existing methods whenever possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Add a "Reset All" button that appears to the right of the <code>lengthDisplay TextField</code></strong>. This button should set the length to 100 and the thickness to 1. Pay attention to what code you need to write and what code you <em>don't</em> need to write. (And as above, re-use as much code as you can.) While you're at it, maybe you should declare 100 and 1 as constants in the <code>LineModel</code> class.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h3>Swing and MVC</h3>

<p>Let's switch gears a bit and look at Swing components themselves. For example, what do we know about the <code>JTextField</code> class. Which of the following are responsibilities/behaviors of this class?
<ol type="a">
    <li> Store some text data
    <li> Display some text data
    <li> Respond to some keyboard entries
  </ol></p>

  <p>While you're thinking about that, look at the <code>JList</code>
  discussion on p. 417 of the book. Which of these are
    responsibilities of this class?

    <ol type="a">
      <li>Store a list of objects
      <li>Remember which objects have been "selected"
      <li>Display the values of the objects in the list
      <li>Respond to mouse-clicks
    </ol>

    Actually, most of the Swing UI components have these
    responsibilities: storing some data, presenting that data, and
    allowing users to interact with that
    data. (OK, a <code>JButton</code> doesn't have that much going
    on&mdash;but that's one of the exceptions.) By the way, for those
    two multiple choice questions, all of the listed items are
    correct. In preparation for this week's exercise read
 <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/java-swing/156592455X/ch01s04.html">this short excerpt</a> that discusses MVC generally as well as its application within Swing. Also, read the introductory text in the documentation for
 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JList.html">JList</a>, paying particular attention to the discussions about <code>ListModel</code>, <code>ListSelectionModel</code>, and how cells are "painted" (i.e. the View).</p>

  <h3>Introducing the <code>Currency</code> class</h3>

  <p>In Project 2, we'll use these ideas to assemble
  a <em>slightly</em> complex Swing application. But for this
    exercise, we'll focus on one non-Swing class (<code>Currency</code>)
    and the <code>JList</code>
  component. First, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Currency.html"><code>Currency</code></a>. As
    the docs say, this is a class whose instances represent currencies, using the ISO 4217 standard. This is an international standard; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">Wikipedia page for the standard</a> includes a table of active codes&mdash;basically, this is the standard that assigns three-letter codes, like <code>USD</code> for the United States dollar. If you ever exchange money, you see these codes in use. And software applications that deal with currency exchange also use these codes (as well as some related standards).</p>


  <h3>Customizing a <code>JList</code></h3>

  <p>But for now, let's work on making a list of <code>Currency</code>s
  available to our users. Take a look
    at <a href="CurrencyList.java">this code</a>. It declares an array
    of <code>Currency</code> objects, then creates
  a <code>JList&lt;Currency&gt;</code> that holds those objects (note
    the <code>JList</code> constructor that lets me create the list
    from an array of objects). Maybe you want to check the wikipedia page about currency codes to find out what those codes represent. Notice, too: this is not
    a <code>JList</code> of <code>String</code>s, and I haven't given
    any instructions about how the <code>JList</code> is supposed to
  display each of the currencies in the list. What will happen? Make a
  hypothesis, then run the
  code and find out. Was your hypothesis correct? Why does the program
    have this behavior?</p>

<p>Maybe you don't think this behavior is the best; I certainly
  don't. How can we address this? Well, remember that one of the
  responsibilities of <code>JList</code> is to display its
  contents. If we
  consult <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JList.html">the
    documentation</a>, we learn (several paragraphs down) that
  "Painting of cells in a <code>JList</code> is handled by a delegate
  called a cell renderer." That is, every <code>JList</code> object
  has an instance variable that refers to an object implementing
  the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/javax/swing/ListCellRenderer.html"><code>ListCellRenderer</code> interface</a>. And, importantly, we
  can tell the <code>JList</code> to use a different cell renderer by passing a reference (to the
  cell renderer we want) to the <code>setCellRenderer()</code> method
  of <code>JList</code>.</p>

<p>So, if we want to customize how our list items are displayed, we
  just need to write our own class implementing that interface. Note
  that the interface only includes one
  method, <code>getListCellRendererComponent()</code>, but it looks
  like it has to do a lot of work. We don't want to do that much
  work!&mdash;we just want to tweak the "default behavior" a little
  bit. This sounds a little bit like the situation with
  the <code>paintComponent()</code> method. The "default painting behavior" of
  a <code>JPanel</code> is not helpful to us (it basically does
  nothing), but the <code>paintComponent()</code> method does a lot of
  work that we actually can't do ourselves. The solution there was to
  start with the <code>JPanel</code> class and then override the
  default behavior of <code>paintComponent()</code> with our own
  behavior. This raises a question: is there a class out there that
  does the "default cell renderer" behavior? If you look closely at
  the <code>JList</code> documentation, you might find something that
  says "See also: .... <code>DefaultListCellRenderer</code>." Hmmm
  interesting! Look at <em>that</em> documentation: not only does it
  implement the <code>ListCellRenderer</code> interface, but it
  also <code>extends JLabel</code>! That is, by default,
  a <code>JList</code> is displayed with a bunch
  of <code>JLabel</code>s!</p>

  <p>But the real point is that, just as we can change how a <code>JPanel</code> is painted by overriding the <code>paintComponent()</code> method, we can change how <code>JList</code>cells are rendered just by subclassing the default renderer. So, this is your first
  task (after all this reading): <strong>modify
    the <code>CurrencyList</code> code to display
    each <code>Currency</code> in a more user-friendly way</strong>. <p>

  <p>A few notes about this, though:
    <ul>
      <li>You only want to write code that changes the behavior you
      don't like. You want to keep all the rest of the behavior of the
      default renderer (even though we don't know exactly what that
        behavior is). That is, you want your overridden
       <code>getListCellRendererComponent()</code> method to use the
        "default" behavior from the superclass <strong>first</strong>,
        then make your modifications.</li>
      <li>Look at the method parameters&mdash;some of them aren't
        relevant to this task, but maybe some of them are!</li>
      <li>Remember that the class you're writing
        IS-A <code>JLabel</code>, so you have all those <code>JLabel</code> methods
        available to you through inheritance.</li>
      <li>You might want to look at the <code>Currency</code>
      documentation to see if there's anything that can help you get a
        better-looking description.
        <li>Yes, this is a job for an inner class! Like the other
        inner classes we've written so far, the amount of code we
        actually need to write is quite small&mdash;you shouldn't need
        to write more than about 4 lines of "method body" code.
    </ul>

    <h3>Another <code>JList</code> customization</h3>

  <p>OK, let's do something crazy... let's let <em>the user</em> add
    currencies to this list. According to the <code>Currency</code> API,
    we can create <code>Currency</code> objects using the <code>getInstance()</code> method, which takes a three-letter currency code as a parameter. So, let's add to the user interface&mdash; <strong>put in
    a <code>JTextField</code> where a user can enter a currency code,
    and a button labeled "Add" that the user can click to add the
      language to the list of currencies</strong>. (While you're at it, you might
    want to put a few more <code>JLabel</code>s in so the user can tell what
    she's looking at.) To make this work, the main thing we need to do
    is implement the button listener. There's two issues here...</p>

<p>First: how do we add something to a <code>JList</code>?
  There are a lot of methods in the API, but none seem to involve
    changing the <em>contents</em> of the list. But wait!
  A <code>JList</code> is an MVC-style component (which element of MVC
    did we fiddle with above?)... and if we're talking about
  the <em>contents</em> of the list, it sounds like we're talking
    about the <em>model</em>. And actually, yeah, this is the first
  thing discussed in the API documentation. The third sentence says
    something about "the <code>JList</code> constructor that
    automatically builds a read-only <code>ListModel</code> instance
    for you." Uh-oh. Read-only? That sounds like I can <em>look
      at</em> the contents, but I can't <em>change</em> them. I don't
    want a read-only <code>ListModel</code>. But hang on&mdash;what is
    this <code>ListModel</code>? Hmmm, let's keep
    reading. Doo-de-doo... ah! "Simple
    dynamic-content <code>JList</code> applications can use
  the <code>DefaultListModel</code> class to maintain list elements."
  That sounds promising... so <strong>pursue that idea in order to complete
      your button's <code>ActionListener</code></strong>.

<p>The second issue has to do with input validation:  what if the user enters an invalid currency code? The <code>getInstance()</code> method says it will "throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>" if it doesn't get a supported currency code, but we haven't studied exceptions yet. We can also check ourselves: the <code>static</code> method <code>Currency.getAvailableCurrencies()</code> will return a collection (a <code>Set</code>, specifically) of supported currencies, and we can use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html"><code>Set</code></a> methods to see if the user's input is valid. (And let's be subtle: if it's
 a legal code, then when the button is clicked, a new currency is added
    to the <code>JList</code> and the text field is cleared. If the
    currency code is not legal, then nothing happens to
    the <code>JList</code> and nothing happens to
    the <code>JTextField</code> either.</p>
