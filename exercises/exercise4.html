  <h2>Exercise 4: Model-View-Controller</h2>

  <h3>Objectives:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Implement a Swing application</li>
    <li>Understand the elements of the Model-View-Controller design
      pattern</li>
    <li>Be able to customize the behavior of some Swing components
  </ul>

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>In this exercise, you're not going to have to write much
    code. The focus of the exercise is on getting into
    the <em>relationship</em> among the objects/classes that make up
    an application. Partly it's about more
    reading-of-the-documentation, and partly it's about seeing how
    object-oriented designs work in practice. There's a fair amount to
    read and think about before you get to the point of writing
    code&mdash;but that's usually how things go on a new project. Of
    course, your endpoint for his exercise will be the starting point
    for Project 2...</p>

  <h3>MVC</h3>
  <p>I talked for a few minutes in class about
  Model-View-Controller. That was no accident. While there are many
  design patterns floating around Java, MVC shows up a lot in
  Swing. And beginning to think in terms of design patterns is an
  important step in your development as a software developer. (For
    example, there are
  a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+design+pattern+design+patterns+books&sa=X">ton</a>
  of books written about design patterns, many focusing on a
    particular programming language.)</p>

  <p>As we saw in the big-small-circle application, MVC is often used
  to structure the user interface of an application; it's a useful way
  make sure we're keeping the three kinds of behavior fairly separate
  from each other (and therefore making sure that we're not
  programming like that jerk Larry). But think about what we know
    about (for example) the <code>JTextField</code> class. Which of
  the following are responsibilities/behaviors of this class?
<ol type="a">
    <li> Store some text data
    <li> Display some text data
    <li> Respond to some keyboard entries
  </ol></p>

  <p>While you're thinking about that, look at the <code>JList</code>
  discussion on p. 417 of the book. Which of these are
    responsibilities of this class?

    <ol type="a">
      <li>Store a list of objects
      <li>Remember which objects have been "selected"
      <li>Display the values of the objects in the list
      <li>Respond to mouse-clicks
    </ol>

    Actually, most of the Swing UI components have these
    responsibilities: storing some data, presenting that data, and
    allowing users to interact with that
    data. (OK, a <code>JButton</code> doesn't have that much going
    on&mdash;but that's one of the exceptions.) By the way, for those
    two multiple choice questions, all of the listed items are
    correct. (You can read more about Swing and
    MVC <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/java-swing/156592455X/ch01s04.html">here</a>,
    and more about the story for text components specifically
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/javax/swing/text/JTextComponent.html">here</a>,
    if you like.)</p>

  <h3>Introducing the <code>Locale</code> class</h3>

  <p>In Project 2, we'll use these ideas to assemble
  a <em>slightly</em> complex Swing application. But for this
    exercise, we'll focus on one non-Swing class (<code>Locale</code>)
    and the <code>JList</code>
  component. First, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html"><code>Locale</code></a>. As
  the docs say, this is a class whose instances represent "a specific
  geographical, political, or cultural region." This is obviously
  something important to many applications&mdash;so much so that there
  are several international standards that address how to represent
  and identify locales; some of the behavior of this class is based on
    those standards. So why do we care about locale? It might help us
  if we want our application to be presented in the right language to
  its user. But other things besides language depend on locale, like
  how dates are formatted, how numbers are written, and specifically
  how currencies are written. You can do all kinds of things with locales, but you might not be
    surprised that some classes in the Java API are
    "<code>Locale</code> sensitive." Among them
    are <code>NumberFormat</code>, <code>Currency</code>,
    and <code>DateFormat</code>. We'll deal more with those later...!</p>

  <h3>Customizing a <code>JList</code></h3>
  <p>But for now, let's work on making a list of <code>Locale</code>s
  available to our users. Take a look
    at <a href="LocaleList.java">this code</a>. It declares an array
    of <code>Locale</code> objects, then creates
  a <code>JList&lt;Locale&gt;</code> that holds those objects (note
    the <code>JList</code> constructor that lets me create the list
    from an array of objects). Notice, too: this is not
    a <code>JList</code> of <code>String</code>s, and I haven't given
    any instructions about how the <code>JList</code> is supposed to
  display each of the locales in the list. What will happen? Make a
  hypothesis, then run the
  code and find out. Was your hypothesis correct? Why does the program
    have this behavior?</p>

<p>Maybe you don't think this behavior is the best; I certainly
  don't. How can we address this? Well, remember that one of the
  responsibilities of <code>JList</code> is to display its
  contents. If we
  consult <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/javax/swing/JList.html">the
    documentation</a>, we learn (several paragraphs down) that
  "Painting of cells in a <code>JList</code> is handled by a delegate
  called a cell renderer." That is, every <code>JList</code> object
  has an instance variable that refers to an object that implements
  the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/javax/swing/ListCellRenderer.html"><code>ListCellRenderer</code> interface</a>. And, importantly, we
  can change the cell renderer we use by passing a reference (to the
  cell renderer we want) to the <code>setCellRenderer()</code> method
  of <code>JList</code>.</p>

<p>So, if we want to customize how our list items are displayed, we
  just need to write our own class implementing that interface. Note
  that the interface only includes one
  method, <code>getListCellRendererComponent()</code>, but it looks
  like it has to do a lot of work. We don't want to do that much
  work!&mdash;we just want to tweak the "default behavior" a little
  bit. This sounds a little bit like the situation with
  the <code>paintComponent()</code> method. The "default painting behavior" of
  a <code>JPanel</code> is not helpful to us (it basically does
  nothing), but the <code>paintComponent()</code> method does a lot of
  work that we actually can't do ourselves. The solution there was to
  start with the <code>JPanel</code> class and then override the
  default behavior of <code>paintComponent()</code> with our own
  behavior. This raises a question: is there a class out there that
  does the "default cell renderer" behavior? If you look closely at
  the <code>JList</code> documentation, you might find something that
  says "See also: .... <code>DefaultListCellRenderer</code>." Hmmm
  interesting! Look at <em>that</em> documentation: not only does it
  implement the <code>ListCellRenderer</code> interface, but it
  also <code>extends JLabel</code>! That is, by default,
  a <code>JList</code> is displayed with a bunch
  of <code>JLabel</code>s!</p>

<p>But the real point is that we can change how cells are rendered
  just by subclassing the default renderer. So, this is your first
  task (after all this reading): <strong>modify
    the <code>LocaleList</code> code to display
    each <code>Locale</code> in a more user-friendly way</strong>. <p>

  <p>A few notes about this, though:
    <ul>
      <li>You only want to write code that changes the behavior you
      don't like. You want to keep all the rest of the behavior of the
      default renderer (even though we don't know exactly what that
        behavior is). That is, you want your overridden
       <code>getListCellRendererComponent()</code> method to the
        "default" behavior from the superclass <strong>first</strong>,
        then make your modifications.</li>
      <li>Look at the method parameters&mdash;some of them aren't
        relevant to this task, but maybe some of them are!</li>
      <li>Remember that the class you're writing
      IS-A <code>JLabel</code>, so you have all those methods
        available to you.</li>
      <li>You might want to look at the <code>Locale</code>
      documentation to see if there's anything that can help you get a
        better-looking description.
        <li>Yes, this is a job for an inner class! Like the other
        inner classes we've written so far, the amount of code we
        actually need to write is quite small&mdash;you shouldn't need
        to write more than about 4 lines of "method body" code.
    </ul>

    <h3>Another <code>JList</code> customization</h3>

  <p>OK, let's do something crazy... let's let <em>the user</em> add
    locales to this list. According to the <code>Locale</code> API,
    the simplest way to create a <code>Locale</code> is with a
    language code. So, let's add to the user interface&mdash; <strong>put in
    a <code>JTextField</code> where a user can enter a language code,
    and a button labeled "Add" that the user can click to add the
      language to the list of locales</strong>. (While you're at it, you might
    want to put some <code>JLabel</code>s in so the user can tell what
    she's looking at.) To make this work, the main thing we need to do
    is implement the button listener. There's two issues here...</p>

  <p>First, what if the user enters an invalid language code?
  The <code>Locale</code> documentation says that the constructor
  doesn't do any checking, so we should check ourselves. Fortunately,
    the <code>Locale</code> class will give an array of all legal
    language codes; we just have to
  call <code>Locale.getISOLanguages</code>. Also, how do we tell the
  user whether the code was legal or not? Let's be subtle: if it's
  legal code, then when the button is clicked, a new locale is added
    to the <code>JList</code> and the text field is cleared. If the
    language code is not legal, then nothing happens to
    the <code>JList</code> and nothing happens to
    the <code>JTextField</code> either.</p>

  <p>The other issue: how do we add something to a <code>JList</code>?
  There are a lot of methods in the API, but none seem to involve
    changing the <em>contents</em> of the list. But wait!
  A <code>JList</code> is an MVC-style component (which element of MVC
    did we fiddle with above?)... and if we're talking about
  the <em>contents</em> of the list, it sounds like we're talking
    about the <em>model</em>. And actually, yeah, this is the first
  thing discussed in the API documentation. The third sentence says
    something about "the <code>JList</code> constructor that
    automatically builds a read-only <code>ListModel</code> instance
    for you." Uh-oh. Read-only? That sounds like I can <em>look
      at</em> the contents, but I can't <em>change</em> them. I don't
    want a read-only <code>ListModel</code>. But hang on&mdash;what is
    this <code>ListModel</code>? Hmmm, let's keep
    reading. Doo-de-doo... ah! "Simple
    dynamic-content <code>JList</code> applications can use
  the <code>DefaultListModel</code> class to maintain list elements."
  That sounds promising... so <strong>pursue that idea in order to complete
      your button <code>ActionListener</code></strong>.
